# Step 1: What is the event about?
eventDetails:
  - eventType: REACH
    about: the parcel of &O
    reward:
      - type: GOLD
        min: 2
        max: 15
# Step 2: Who is involved?
# If you only have a single NPC involved in the event, skip this step. If you have two NPCs involved, use 'npc' and
# 'targetNpc' to define the dialogue for the "event giver" and the target NPC respectively.
#
# Step 3: What are the states of the event?
# Add a dialogue section for each event state i.e. available, active, ready, completed, and declined. For simple
# dialogues with no objectives/progression, add a single section with the name 'none'.
#
# Step 4: What are the interactions in each dialogue?
# - The top-level interaction permits 'text' (mandatory), player 'actions' (optional), 'i' (optional), & 'n' (optional)
# - 'n' (optional, accepts: int >= 0)
#   Specifies the index of the next interaction. Any number outside the range of the interactions will be
#   reset the dialogue to its beginning.
# - 'i' (optional, accepts: int >= 0)
#    Use as a helper that will be ignored when parsing to identify next interaction when using 'n'
# - 'actions' (required to conclude a dialogue or change state of an event, accepts: list of actions)
#   The choices a player can make. Required A dialogue can ONLY be concluded by changing the playerState. You must
#   provide 1) 'name' and 2) 'playerState' OR 'eventState'.
# - 'name' (required, accepts: String)
# - 'playerState' (optional, accepts: AT_POI, AT_LOCATION, etc.)
#    Changes the state of the player and immediately conclude the dialogue.
# - 'eventState' (optional, accepts: NONE, AVAILABLE, ACTIVE, READY, COMPLETED, or DECLINED)
#    Changes the state of the event AND the active dialogue immediately i.e. no further interactions in the current
#    dialogue will be displayed.
# - 'nextInteraction' (optional, accepts: int >= 0 and <= size of interactions in dialogue)
#   Used in combination with 'eventState: NONE' to indicate the next interaction; this is how you branch the
#   dialogue based on player decisions.
