# Option 1: Add a dialogue section for each event state i.e. available, active, ready, completed, and declined.
# Option 2: Add a single section with the name 'none' for simple dialogues with no objectives/progression.
# - The top-level interaction permits 'text' (mandatory), player 'actions' (optional), 'i' (optional), & 'n' (optional)
# - 'n' (optional, accepts: int >= 0)
#   Specifies the index of the next interaction. Any number outside the range of the interactions will be
#   reset the dialogue to its beginning.
# - 'i' (optional, accepts: int >= 0)
#    Use as a helper that will be ignored when parsing to identify next interaction when using 'n'
# - 'actions' (required to conclude a dialogue or change state of an event, accepts: list of actions)
#   The choices a player can make. Required A dialogue can ONLY be concluded by changing the playerState. You must
#   provide 1) 'index', 2) 'name', and 3) 'playerState' OR 'eventState'.
# - 'index' (required, accepts: int >= 1)
#    The index of the action. Must start with 1 for every list of actions.
# - 'name' (required, accepts: String)
# - 'playerState' (optional, accepts: AT_POI, AT_LOCATION, etc.)
#    Changes the state of the player and immediately conclude the dialogue.
# - 'eventState' (optional, accepts: NONE, AVAILABLE, ACTIVE, READY, COMPLETED, or DECLINED)
#    Changes the state of the event AND the active dialogue immediately i.e. no further interactions in the current
#    dialogue will be displayed.
# - 'nextInteraction' (optional, accepts: int >= 0 and <= size of interactions in dialogue)
#   Used in combination with 'eventState: NONE' to indicate the next interaction; this is how you branch the
#   dialogue based on player decisions.
