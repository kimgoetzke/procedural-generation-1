(Looks away.)
(Ignores you.)

Can't talk right now.
Can't you see I'm busy?
I don't want to talk to you.
I'm busy.

I'm not in the mood.
I'm not talking to you.
I'm not talking to you, so go away.
I'm not talking to you, so leave me alone.
I'm not talking to you, so leave me be.
I'm not talking to you, so leave me in peace.
I'm not talking to you, so leave me.
Leave me be.
Leave me in peace.
Leave me alone.
Move along.
Move along, please.
Move along, please. I'm busy.
Move along, please. I'm not interested.
Go away.
