# Procedural Generation Project 1

This project was my first attempt to procedurally generate a near-infinite world.

### To do

- Give inhabitants professions
- Create quests
- Create amenities with specific functions i.e. shops

##### Notes

This project uses `google-java-format` to format the code. See https://github.com/google/google-java-format for more details on how to set it up and use it.
